                <h2>About Website</h2>
                <p>This webiste is made as an Academic Project. In this website we implemented some
                    most famous scheduling algorithms
                </p>
                <p>
                    A website that calculates 5 different job scheduling algorithms could be a tool for computer science
                    students, educators, or professionals to learn about and experiment with different job scheduling
                    algorithms in a practical way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website could feature a user-friendly interface where users can input job parameters such as
                    arrival
                    time, execution time, and priority, and select from a list of available scheduling algorithms to
                    calculate the order in which the jobs should be executed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some examples of scheduling algorithms that could be included on the website are:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) - Jobs are executed in the order they arrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.Shortest Job First (SJF) - Jobs with the shortest execution time are executed first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.Round Robin - Jobs are executed in a cyclic order with a fixed time quantum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.Multi-level Queue Scheduling - Jobs are classified into multiple priority queues, each with its
                    own
                    scheduling algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.Multi-level feedback Queue Scheduling - Jobs are classified into multiple priority queues in a
                    multi-level feedback queue, with each queue having a different time quantum and feedback mechanism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website could display the calculated order of execution for each algorithm, as well as relevant
                    performance metrics such as average waiting time and turnaround time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, a website that provides a tool for calculating and comparing different job scheduling
                    algorithms can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the behavior and
                    performance of these algorithms in a practical setting.
